Sementic segmentation in xray dataset

## Introduction

## Architecture

**Unet** consists of two parts a contracting side and an expansive side, and create
an elegant U shape architecture. Each side is composed of multiple layers which are built
from 3x3 convolution layers followed by ReLU and a 2x2 max pool. One impressive operation is 
up sampling and next I'll deep diving into this technique.
